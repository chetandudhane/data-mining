# Data Mining - Clustering and Prediction Modelling
This project involves Clustering of Bank Customers and Predicting Insurance claims.

Inferences are drawn from 2 case studies, namely - Bank Marketing & Insurance. The concepts of Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network are used to draw inferences from these case studies. Various performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of predictions on Test & Train sets

### Skills and Tools
Clustering (Hierarchical and K-Means), CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks
